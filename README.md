# UPDATE - September 2018

We have developed a replacement for RawQuant called RawTools. RawTools has been built from the ground up in C# and built on the Thermo RawFileReader library. As a result of these changes, RawTools is substantially faster at data processing compared with RawQuant, and is compatible with data handling on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. RawTools also includes a large collection of new features, including quality control tracking!

RawTools is open source and freely available. RawTools can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawTools).

As a result of the development of RawTools, support for RawQuant will be phased out.

# RawQuant

RawQuant is a Python package for extracting scan meta data and quantification values from Thermo .raw files.

For information on getting started and using RawQuant, please refer to the [installation and tutorial file](https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawQuant/blob/master/docs/RawQuant_Instructions_ver-May2018.md). The [paper describing the RawQuant tool](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00072) is available.

RawQuant is live on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RawQuant)!
